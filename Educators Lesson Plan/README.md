# Bitcoin Diploma Lesson Plan

This is a complementary and comprehensive lesson plan designed to assist educators who wish to share and teach the Bitcoin Diploma in their own communities. It includes detailed guidance on:

- **Objectives of the Chapter**: Clearly defined goals for each chapter to ensure students grasp the key concepts.
- **Materials and Resources**: A list of necessary materials and resources for each class.
- **Class General Outline and Activities**: An overview of the class structure, activities, and the estimated duration for each section.
- **Discussion Points**: Key discussion points for each chapter to help students understand and apply the essential concepts as they progress in the Diploma.

We believe this will help teachers, tutors, and educators. This resource aims to facilitate the teaching of the main material and make it more accessible, easy to go through, and engaging for learners of all ages.
