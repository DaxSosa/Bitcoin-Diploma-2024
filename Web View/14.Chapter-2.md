> "Money is a guarantee that we may have what we want in the future. Though we need nothing at the moment, it ensures the possibility of satisfying a new desire when it arises."

- ⭐ Why or why not?
- ⭐ What makes one bill so desirable and another one as good as trash?
- ⭐ What gives money its “value”?
- ⭐ Where does money come from and who decides how much of it to print?

### ***2.0 Definition of Money***  

Have you ever stopped to think about what money really is? Ever wonder what makes money…well, money? Most of us know how to use it, but not many of us understand where it comes from or how it works. Money is essentially a way to exchange goods and services. It represents the value of these items in a form that can be easily traded. This can take many different forms, such as paper notes, metal coins, and electronic payments. Governments or other authorities typically issue and control money, but money is so much more than just a physical or digital medium of exchange; it’s like a universal language that allows us to trade with people all around the world, even if we don’t speak the same language or have the same culture. For example, you can be on the other side of the world and still “speak” money by placing a product on the counter and exchanging it for the local currency or using a credit card.
