### ***2.0 Introduction***  

> "Money is a guarantee that we may have what we want in the future. Though we need nothing at the moment, it ensures the possibility of satisfying a new desire when it arises."    
 **$\color[RGB]{250,175,64} Aristotle$**

<br/>

Building upon our exploration of the necessity of money, this chapter explores the core question: What is money? We‚Äôll start off with a group discussion and activity.

<br/>
<br/>

### _Activity: Class Discussion - ‚ÄúWhat is Money?‚Äù_

- ‚≠ê Please do not eat the piece of candy placed on your desk yet.
- ‚≠ê Who would be willing to trade their candy for a US$1 bill?
- ‚≠ê Now, keep your hands up if you would still be willing to trade your candy for a $1 monopoly bill instead of your piece of candy.
- ‚≠ê Why or why not?
- ‚≠ê What makes one bill so desirable and another one as good as trash?
- ‚≠ê What gives money its ‚Äúvalue‚Äù?
- ‚≠ê Where does money come from and who decides how much of it to print?
- ‚≠ê Why not print more money and distribute it among everyone equally?

### ***2.0 Definition of Money***  

Have you ever stopped to think about what money really is? Ever wonder what makes money‚Ä¶well, money? Most of us know how to use it, but not many of us understand where it comes from or how it works. Money is essentially a way to exchange goods and services. It represents the value of these items in a form that can be easily traded. This can take many different forms, such as paper notes, metal coins, and electronic payments. Governments or other authorities typically issue and control money, but money is so much more than just a physical or digital medium of exchange; it‚Äôs like a universal language that allows us to trade with people all around the world, even if we don‚Äôt speak the same language or have the same culture. For example, you can be on the other side of the world and still ‚Äúspeak‚Äù money by placing a product on the counter and exchanging it for the local currency or using a credit card.

Money is like a social contract that allows us to make exchanges without having to rely on bartering or finding someone who specifically wants what we have to offer. If a group of people started accepting chocolate as payment for most goods and services, chocolate would become money (although, since it would melt in some
parts of the world, we might consider it bad money).

As French economist Jean-Baptiste Say pointed out, ‚ÄúMoney performs but a momentary function in an exchange; and when the transaction is finally closed, it will always be found that one kind of commodity has been exchanged for another.‚Äù

In other words, money itself doesn‚Äôt have the power to satisfy human wants; it‚Äôs just a tool that allows us to trade one commodity for another.

- üí° **$\color[RGB]{250,175,64} Transaction$** is an exchange or transfer of goods and services. It is a way of exchanging value between two or more parties.

There are many different types of transactions, ranging from simple exchanges (such as buying a sandwich at a deli) to more complex financial transactions (such as buying a house or investing in stocks or bonds). Transactions can be conducted in person, over the phone, online, or through other means, and they can involve a wide range of parties, including individuals, businesses, and financial institutions.

- üí° Money **$\color[RGB]{250,175,64} IS$** the value **$\color[RGB]{250,175,64} BY$** which goods are exchanged. Money **$\color[RGB]{250,175,64} IS \ NOT$** the value **$\color[RGB]{250,175,64} FOR$** which goods are exchanged

<br/>

**$\color[RGB]{104,59,14} In \ summary, \ money$**:    
Facilitates trade because everyone accepts it as final payment. It also allows us to measure the value and to make comparisons between different goods and services. Next, we‚Äôll look at the function of money.

<br/>
<br/>

### ***2.2 Function of Money***  

When it comes to buying and selling goods and services, money is the key player. Money serves several important functions in the world, like:    

1. **$\color[RGB]{104,59,14} A \ store \ of \ value$**: Money should maintain its value over time, making it useful as a method to save and invest the value of human labor. This lets people use money to plan for the future and borrow and lend money. So, the next time you‚Äôre saving up for something special, remember that money is more than just a way to pay for things ‚Äì it‚Äôs a tool to help you plan and invest in your future.

2. **$\color[RGB]{104,59,14} Medium \ of \ Exchange$**: With money, you don‚Äôt have to find someone who wants exactly what you have to trade. Instead, you can use money to buy and sell anything you want. This makes trading and commerce much more convenient and efficient.

IMAGE

3. **$\color[RGB]{104,59,14} Unit \ of \ Account$**: Money provides a universal standard of value that allows people to express and compare the price of different goods and services. This allows for a more efficient and transparent market, where people can make informed decisions about what to buy and sell.

IMAGE

Think of it like this: if you wanted to buy a new car, you could compare prices from different dealerships and make an informed decision about which one to buy based on the price in dollars. Without a unit of account, you‚Äôd have to try to compare the value of one car to another using something else, like the number of cows it was worth or the length of time it took to make the car.

These three functions are what allow economies to become complex and dynamic. Without money, it would be much harder to buy and sell goods and services, and our economy would be much less developed.

<br/>

**Class Exercise: What function of money is this an example of?**
- ‚≠ê Evan decided to save a portion of his weekly paychecks to buy a puppy.
- ‚≠ê Adam buys two slices of pizza for $8.30 at Ray‚Äôs Pizza.
- ‚≠ê Marc can‚Äôt decide whether to buy concert tickets for $75 or buy a ski pass for $95.

<br/>
<br/>

### ***2.2 Properties of Money***  

Over time, people have ultimately realized that money must possess certain qualities to be effective as a medium of exchange. These characteristics include durability, divisibility, portability, acceptability, scarcity, and fungibility.

### _Activity: Time Preference_

Class Activity. High TIme Preference vs Low TIme Preference

1. ‚≠ê Listen to the teacher‚Äôs explanation of the candy choice.
2. ‚≠ê Decide whether you would like to receive a small candy or marshmallow now or wait until the end of the class to receive two candies or a larger, more desirable candy.
3. ‚≠ê Commit to your decision and let the teacher know your choice. Receive your candy either immediately or at the end of the class, based on your decision.
4. ‚≠ê Participate in the class discussion about the activity, reflecting on your decision-making process and the concept of time preference.

<br/>

**$\color[RGB]{104,59,14} Conclusion \ and \ Discussion$**:
- ‚≠ê What factors influenced your decision to take the candy now or wait for a larger reward later?
- ‚≠ê How do you feel about your decision now that the activity is over?
- ‚≠ê Can you think of real-life examples where high time preference might be harmful and where low time preference might be beneficial?
- ‚≠ê What are some potential consequences of choosing high time preference over low time preference?

<br/>

In the context of the desert example, this means that you might be more inclined to drink all of the water right away, even if it means that you won‚Äôt have any left for later. This is because the thirst you feel right now is more pressing than the potential thirst you might feel in the future.

On the other hand, if you choose to ration the water and drink it slowly over time, you are demonstrating a lower time preference. This means that you are willing to wait to satisfy your thirst and improve your chances of survival. The concept of opportunity cost is closely related to the idea of scarcity and time preference.

- üí° **$\color[RGB]{250,175,64} Opportunity \ cost$** refers to the value of the next best alternative that you give up when you make a decision. **$\color[RGB]{250,175,64} Every \ decision \ involves \ trade-offs.$**

IMAGE

In the desert example, the opportunity cost of drinking all of the water right away is the survival benefits you would have gained from rationing the water and using it over a longer period of time.

Let‚Äôs say you decide to ration the water and take small sips over a longer period of time. As a result, you have the energy and hydration you need to search for more water. However, while you are searching, you come across a cactus that has a small amount of water inside. It‚Äôs not a lot, but it‚Äôs enough to quench your thirst for the moment. If you had decided to drink all of your water at once, you might not have had the energy to search for more water and come across the cactus.

In this case, the opportunity cost of drinking all of your water at once would have been the chance to find the cactus and get more hydration.

This example illustrates how opportunity cost involves not just the immediate trade-off between two options but also the potential future opportunities that may be gained or lost as a result of our choices.

Our willingness to give up a larger reward in the future in exchange for a smaller reward now is influenced by our time preference, or how much we value immediate gratification versus long-term planning.

In this chapter, we explored the fundamental concept of money, covering its definition, functions, properties, and various types. An essential aspect of our discussion involved understanding the psychology of money, focusing on concepts like scarcity, time preference, and tradeoffs. This exploration laid the groundwork for comprehending the complicated nature of money and its role in our lives. In the next chapter, we‚Äôll talk about the history of money and how it has evolved over time.
